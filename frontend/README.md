> Although many video types are supported, `.mp4` would work best

### Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps :

1. **Install Dependencies**:


    ```bash
        npm install

        # If it complains
        npm install --legacy-peer-deps

        # If it still complains, I know it's bad, I'll change the versions later
        npm install --force

    ```

2. Run the dev server :

    ```bash
        npm run dev
    ```

3. Build the app :


    ```bash
        npm run build
    ```
